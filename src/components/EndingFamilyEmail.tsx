    <p><b>Subject: Information on Weaver #11</b></p>
      <p>Hello Investigator,</p>
    
<p>We are reaching out to you on behalf of the parents of an incarcerated individual who is referred to as Weaver #11 in your files.</p>

<p>The parents have had no contact with their child since May, six months after being taken into custody in late November. A trial has still not occurred and there have been no updates.</p>

<p>After extensive research we discovered you were the arresting investigator and wondered if you may have personal notes or access to internal information to help locate Weaver #11 in the prison system and allow this family to be reunited.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, they are very anxious for any updates on the trial, but mostly want to make sure their child is still alive following these reports of prison conditions being released.</p>

      <p>Thank you for your time and attention,</p>

      <p>Samharan Prisonersâ€™ Rights Association</p>
