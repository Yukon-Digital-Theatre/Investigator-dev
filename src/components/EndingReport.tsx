		  <p><b>Report from Ialo NGO</b></p>
	
			  <p>October 28, 2022</p>

	<p>Following extensive investigations an NGO from Ialo working in postwar Samharan has called for the immediate termination of the War Crimes Investigation Council (WCIC) to be replaced by the International Criminal Court.</p>

	<p>The WCIC has failed to prosecute those arrested in a reasonable timeframe, with over 60% of those imprisoned yet to be formally charged. Furthermore, they failed to find sufficient space to house those awaiting prosecution and trial resulting in severe overcrowding of the prisons.</p>

	<p>Particularly in the Capital conditions resulted in prisoners being unable to sit or lie down or use sanitation facilities. This has resulted in widespread illness and infections, especially of feet and legs due to poor sanitation and days of standing. These infections have occasionally led to amputations and death.</p>

	<p>There is also evidence that the WCIC overreached in some cases by arresting those with insufficient evidence of knowledge and intent. While it is commendable that the WCIC wanted to ensure few of those responsible for the genocide went unpunished, a mistake made throughout history, they failed to follow due process.</p>
	
	<p>As well as terminating the WCIC immediately, it has been recommended to do further investigations into the past and present WCIC staff. </p>
