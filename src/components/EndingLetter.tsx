      <p><br></br>Hello from sunny Ci-Liva!</p> 
      <p><br></br>I hope this letter finds you alright. Took a while to get settled in here and find your address. I hope I remembered your name correctly, I only saw it briefly on your badge. I just wanted to thank you for your act of kindness almost a year ago now. While it was hard to move across the ocean (I miss my family terribly), I am grateful for the fresh start. And I’m not the only Samha here of course. Many of us came here for a new start. It’s nice to have a community from home. I had to work in a couple factories as I got settled, but I found a place now and almost have enough to purchase a loom. I’d love to make you something, if you can confirm this is your address? Maybe tell me something we talked about that day to confirm it’s you? Apologies for being vague, I suppose I’m just a bit too scared to be more blunt. I hope you understand. I’ve heard those reports coming out of Samharan of the conditions in prison, it’s awful, and I am even more grateful. I didn’t think that was possible, but I am! I hope you are well.</p> 
      <p><br></br>Your friend, The Weaver</p>
