		  <p><b>Subject: Exit Interview November 15</b></p>
		  <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Just wanted to quickly let you know prior to your exit interview we are particularly interested in any notes or recollections you have from your interrogation of Weaver #11. We understand this suspect ran away and was never apprehended. While we have released a number of weavers due to insufficient evidence there are a handful we are detaining as there was a consultation process in which some weavers were told about the origins of the yarn. We have identified a number of weavers who participated in this process, but several remain unidentified. We have descriptions of some of these and believe Weaver #11 may be a match.</p>

		  <p>Thank you in advance,</p>

		  <p>ICC Administration</p>
